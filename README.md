Welcome to my remote sensing portfolio!  
This repository showcases projects I’ve completed as part of my **Geography & IT studies** at Rutgers University, with a focus on **GIS, remote sensing, and environmental analysis**.  

Each project demonstrates my ability to work with satellite imagery, apply geospatial methods, and communicate results through maps and analysis.
