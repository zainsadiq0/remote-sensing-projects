Welcome to my remote sensing portfolio!  
This repository showcases projects I‚Äôve completed as part of my **Geography & IT studies** at Rutgers University, with a focus on **GIS, remote sensing, and environmental analysis**.  

Each project demonstrates my ability to work with satellite imagery, apply geospatial methods, and communicate results through maps and analysis.

## üìÇ Projects

### 1. NYC Vegetation Growth Analysis (2013‚Äì2024)
- **Objective:** Measure vegetation change in New York City over a decade.  
- **Data:** Landsat 8 imagery.  
- **Methods:**  
  - Band stacking  
  - NDVI calculation  
  - Raster reclassification & visualization  
- **Results:** Created change detection maps highlighting areas of vegetation growth and decline.  
- **Skills:** Raster processing, temporal analysis, NDVI, cartographic visualization.
